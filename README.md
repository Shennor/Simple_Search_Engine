# Simple_Search_Engine

This is my implementation of a [project](https://hyperskill.org/projects/89) from the [JetBrainAcademy](https://hyperskill.org/tracks) platform.

### About
In this project you will create your own search engine, though it probably won’t compete with Google. Yours will be a simple search engine that processes a limited collection of data and searches it for a word or a phrase. It’ll be simple but cool.
